    "text": "Welcome to Homo Calculans, a project run by Michael Falk at the University of Melbourne.\nThe overall aim of the project is to assess how researchers in the Human Sciences adopted computational research methods in the first two decades of electronic computing. To do this, the project will pose three research questions about early Computational Human Sciences (CHS):\nRQ1. What were the central methods of study across the different disciplines?\nRQ2. How did scholars explain and justify their new methods? What rhetorical or affective devices did they use to obtain acceptance for their results?\nRQ3. How can this history help us understand the breadth of CHS today?\nThese questions have been asked of individual disciplines, but never of the Human Sciences as a whole. Historians have described the ‘quantitative revolution’ in Geography, the ‘cognitive revolution’ in Psychology, the rise of ‘simulation’ in Economics, and the emergence of ‘humanities computing’ in Literature, History and Linguistics (Gyuris, Michel, and Paulus 2022; Smith 1997; Morgan 2004; Jones 2016) – but to date no scholar has attempted a synoptic view of how computer methods affected research across the Human Sciences. Today, CHS has divided into two main fields: Computational Social Sciences (CSS) and Digital Humanities (DH). But this bifurcation fails to capture the full breadth of computational research today, and overlooks the way early practitioners of CHS such as J.C. Gardin, Herb Simon and P.J. Stone straddled the disciplines. A fresh look at this early period will help to reopen the walled gardens of DH and CSS.\nTo answer the research questions, I will assemble a corpus of early research publications in CHS, and study them using both close reading and corpus analysis. Thus the project is innovative in two respects: (1) in its comparative approach; and (2) in its use of digital methods. While comparative research is not new in the history of the Human Sciences, this project will be the first to compare computational methods across the Human Sciences in the first age of computing; and while it is becoming more common for scholars to digitally analyse corpora of academic articles as evidence in intellectual history (Jordanous and Keller 2016; Sula and Hill 2019; Falk 2024), this remains a young and fast-moving area with ample scope for methodological innovation.\nThe project will lead to a demonstrable conceptual advance because of its original research question and innovative methods. It will elucidate, for the first time, how the Human Sciences fared in the first two decades of electronic computing, using computational methods to observe how the very language of the Human Sciences changed to register the impact of the computer.\nHomo Calculans is funded by an ECR Grant at the University of Melbourne (2025ECRG089).\nImage: CSIRAC (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer), Australia’s first digital computer, and the fourth stored program computer in the world.

    "text": "Methods and Madness\n\nHamlet\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is\nsoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.\n\nWhat makes methods ‘mad’? In the Humanities and Social Sciences, ‘method’ has usually been a bulwark of sanity. Methods ensure that objects exist. When scholars use the proper methods, they can ensure that their research is ‘objective’, a key epistemic virtue in the Humanities since the 1800s (Daston 2014). Methods achieve objectivity in the same way recipes achieve dishes. A good recipe always cooks the same cake, no matter the cook. Since the cake doesn’t depend on the cook, we can agree that the cake is an independent object, that does not rely on the intervention of a particular human subject. Like recipes, research methods guarantee the independence of the objects of research. Some Humanists and Social Scientists have embraced methodical objectivity, especially as computation has enabled more complex and sophisticated methods in all branches of research. Others have rejected methodical objectivity as an improper encroachment of positivism into humanistic learning.\nThis workshop offers a third approach, inspired by the ‘counter-methods’ of Paul Feyerabend (1975), the ‘assemblage methods’ of John Law (2004), the ‘pataphysical’ methods of Stephen Ramsay (2011), the ‘interface methods’ of Noortje Marres and Carolin Geerlitz (2016), and the creative works of algorithmic artists from Laurie Spiegel to Refik Anadol. Sure, methods might create objects—but do they always have to create the same, sane ones? How might digital methods help us to reimagine, reshape or recreate the world?"

Structured. Fun. Totally professional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRound\nDiscussion Prompt\n\n\n\n\n1\nWhat makes a method ‘digital’? Are there any methods you aren’t sure about?\n\n\n2\nDoes the qualitative/quantitative distinction apply to digital methods in your work or discipline? Why or why not?\n\n\n3\nWhat is the biggest impact digital methods have had on your respective disciplines?\n\n\n4\nAre Digital Humanities/Social Sciences necessarily positivist or empirical? If so, or if not, is this a problem?\n\n\n5\nIs it necessary to be interdisciplinary to use digital methods?\n\n\n6\nWhat are the ethical implications of using digital methods today?\n\n\n\nIf you don’t use specific ‘digital methods’ in your work, you can think about the digital mediation of your (non)-digital methods. For example, using databases for literature search or to view archival materials.\n\n\n11:30 | Method and Materiality\nKath Bode (ANU) presents her critical study of the materiality of digital methods.\nKath is Professor of Literary and Textual Studies at the Australian National University. She is the author of two pathbreaking books in Computational Literary Studies: Reading By Numbers (2012) and A World of Fiction: Digital Collections and the Future of Literary History (2018). Kath has made her name as a powerful critic of so-called “distant reading,” but unlike other critics of this trend in scholarship, Kath has launched her critique from within digital humanities. She proposes a unique approach the digital text, rooted in the classic techniques of textual scholarship. In this talk, Kath will give us a sneak peek of her next book, provisionally entitled Computing Literature, which draws on her ARC Future Fellowship, Reading at the interface: literatures, cultures, technologies.\n\n\n12:30 | Lunch\nUncatered, sorry!\n\n\n01:30 | Lightning Talks\nPresenters have 7 minutes + 1 slide to present a digital method, and explain how it has impacted their discipline.\nPhilip Pond (Media Studies / Non-time Series)\nJasmin Pfefferkorn (Museum Studies / Digital Walkthrough)\nFinn Morgan (Literary Studies / Heuristics)\nMitch Goodwin (Art / Style Parameters)\nNat Cutter (History / LLMs)\n\n\n02:30 | Mapping as Method\nLuca Scholz (Manchester) presents his work in the history of spatial humanities.\nLuca is a historian and digital humanist, and is Senior Lecturer in the Centre for Digital Humanities, Culture and Media at the University of Manchester. He specialises in the spatial humanities. He is at once an expert in the history of mapping, and in the application of new kinds of digital mapping to history. He is the author of Borders and Freedom of Movement in the Holy Roman Empire, published with OUP in 2020, and is currently working on his second book, a digital history of the amusing European practice of “weather-shooting.” Using the techniques of spatial humanities, Luca is mapping the spread of this bizarre and endearing practice from the 1600s to the 1900s. Today he will talk to us about the kinds of spatial methods he uses, and how they can enlighten the historian.\n\n\n03:30 | Theses on Method\nCollective writing and reflection session. Can we distil today’s discussion into 5, 10 or 15 theses on method?\n\n\n04:00 | Goodbye!"

For now, we can just see which disciplines appear to be represented in the corpus that we have.\nNiles tagged the items in Zotero, which is great because it is flexible, but not so great because the tags are unstructured. First we need to sort the tags into two groups: discipline tags and technology tags.\n\n\nCode\n# Get list of tags for categorisation\ncorpus |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::distinct(tag) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(tag_category = \"\") |&gt; \n  readr::write_csv(\"all-tags.csv\")\n\n# Import categorised tags\ntag_categories &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"all-tags-categorised.csv\")\n\n\nOnce we have (very roughly) categorised the tags, we can take a look at the summary statistics. Figure 2 shows the disciplines represented in the corpus. The corpus already suggests new lines of inquiry. The social science disciplines are not so surprising, but it is intriguing to note the presence of many Visual Arts and Musiology articles. These disciplines do not feature heavily in the mainstream historiography of Digital Humanities, which has tended to focus on early efforts in literature and linguistics.\n\n\nCode\ndisciplines &lt;- corpus |&gt; \n  tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(tag_categories, by=\"tag\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(tag_category == \"discipline\", !is.na(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::group_by(tag) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(dplyr::n() &gt; 1)\n\ndisciplines |&gt; \n  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(y=tag)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_bar() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    y = \"Discipline\",\n    x = glue::glue(\"Number of Articles (n = {nrow(disciplines)}).\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Musicology and Visual Arts have probably been overlooked in the early history of CHS.

    "text": "What are the “Human Sciences”? How have they been “computerised”? Both questions have an antique ring. In Australia, where I live and work, no-one calls themself a “human scientist,” except perhaps for the odd biologist or psychologist. And in our “digital” age, terms such as “digitisation,” “digitalisation” or “digital transformation” are far more popular than the old term “computerisation,” which smacks of dusty punch-cards and clunking microcomputers from 1980s schoolrooms.\nAnd yet the question, “how were the human sciences computerised,” is an essential one. Today, computing is more humanistic than ever. The Generative AI revolution has suddenly narrowed the perceived gap between humans and machines. Meanwhile, the growth of surveillance capitalism has made the collection and analysis of human data into a big business and a socio-political nightmare. Now we all have an interest in the question: What can we learn about human beings through the use of computation?\nIn this project, I want to take the question back to the beginning. I want to take it back to the 1950s and 60s, when fast digital computers were brand new, and scholars of humankind were only just getting their hands on them. In those days, the concept of the “computer” was fresh. The metaphors people used to describe computers were live. The arguments people made about the possible applications of computing were wild and often utopian. If we go back to that more creative age, we might be able to reopen that creativity, and address the problems of today.\nThis is a pilot project, that will unfold over the course of 2025. Stay tuned, to learn about how humans were datafied in the early days, and to discover new old ways to harness the power of computation to achieve the age-old goal of the human sciences: a gentler, more philsophical, more enlightened understanding of our plural condition on this fragile earth."

And we have not yet begun to think in ways appropriate to the nature of this machine.(Milic 1966, 4)"

The computer then takes up not only the clerical drudgery, but also the more “intelligent” functions of problem-solving, in a very broad sense.(Gardin 1965)"
