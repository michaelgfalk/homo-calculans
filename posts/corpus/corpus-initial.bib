	abstract = {In this volume the author provides a definition of the technique of simulation in order to examine the relevance of this technique for research in the social sciences. He looks into the philosophical and epistemological bases of simulation, examines its intellectual roots, and illustrates its use in a variety of disciplines--economics, political science, sociology, education, psychology, anthropology, and law. He shows how the technique may be used as an aid to theory building; and how it has been applied to training, teaching, and experimental research. He discusses a means of assessing the validity of simulations and demonstrates the interrelated qualities of usefulness and validity. A bibliography and a subject index are provided.},

	abstract = {Roll-call votes have attracted increasing interest as sources of information about issues in the legislative process. The availability of computer programs for data processing has made it possible to search for salient issues by examining all the roll-call votes in a given Congress, rather than limiting analysis to pre-selected subsets of votes reflecting the judgment of the investigator. One particularly promising set of computer programs for this purpose is the BC TRY system, designed by R. C. Tryon. The purpose of the present paper is to illustrate the applicability of this system to roll-call analysis. 
Various procedures of multivariate analysis are applicable to the identification of legislative issues from roll calls. These include Guttman scaling, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Computer programs are available for these procedures and several versions of them can be performed by particular programs in the BC TRY system. We select for presentation the procedure of non-communality cluster analysis, which is not widely available outside the BC TRY system, and which also has the advantage of making fewer assumptions about communalities than other methods. In addition we present the spherical analysis (SPAN) diagram, which can be computed for any three-dimensional factor space identified by the system. To illustrate these features, we shall use the votes of the Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 84th Congress (1955-56).},

Diverse applications of computer models in social science are discussed, along with a validation study involving HOMUNCULUS, a computer model of social behavior. Hypotheses concerning decision making in a role-conflict dilemma were stated operationally as computer routines compatible with HOMUNCULUS. In computer runs using input data from actual questionnaires, alternative formulations regarding role conflict resolution were tested. Since the data generated by each run represented the logical consequences of the hypotheses operating in that run, it was possible to assess the adequacy of each programmed formulation by comparing the simulated responses with the actual decisions of living respondents. Such flexibility and dynamic capacity are major benefits accruing from testing a social theory through computer simulation.},

	abstract = {Much of the business of the U.S. Congress in the post war period has involved issues concerning the size and scope of activities of the federal government. The legislation in this area can be traced, for the most part, to measures which originated during the period of the New Deal in response to the Great Depression and to measures enacted during World War II to meet the short-run exigencies attendant to rapid economic and social mobilization. From the point of view of the expansion of the federal role, the Eisenhower years are of some moment. While they marked a lull in the expansionist trend witnessed under the Democratic presidencies of Roosevelt and Truman, their significance lies in the fact that despite the change in adminsitrations, there was no reversal of the policies begun during the Roosevelt years. While most of the Republican legislators were on record in opposition to the expansion of the federal role, the failure of the Republican Party to introduce and enact legislation to reverse the trend of federal expansion resulted in a new plateau of federal activity from which the congressional dialogue was to proceed during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.
            
              While the 87th Congress, meeting during Kennedy's first two years in the White House, did not enact the quantity of legislation expanding the federal role that Kennedy had called for in his inaugural, In the 88th Congress both parties supported a larger federal role to a greater extent than they had previously. In fact the first sessions of the 88th Congress as it bears on the federal role has been summed up as follows: “At no time did the majority of both parties reject a larger federal role.” (
              Congressional Quarterly Almanac
              , 1963, p. 724) With two exceptions, the statement holds true for the second session in 1964.},

The model had four basic equations and included provision for one- and two-dimensional tracking, repetitive and irregular input signals, and practice trials. Four groups of 12 human subjects each were given 40 practice trials on either one- or two-dimensional tracking, and either repetitive or irregular input signals. The model was then used to simulate corresponding data for four groups of 12 hypothetical subjects each, and comparisons of the real and hypothetical subject samples were made for various measures of proficiency. Overall, the adequacy of the simulation was judged as good. Research tactics are discussed for arriving at a generalized model of n-dimensional tracking behavior, and for elaborated models that will include procedural and decision acts to simulate more complex man-machine systems.},

	abstract = {Crisiscom is a computer simulation of national decision makers processing information during a crisis. The project has several purposes:
            1. It is designed to increase our understanding of the process of deterrence by exploring how far the behavior of political decision makers in crisis can be explained by psychological mechanisms. This is done by comparing the output of the highly simplified computer model based on principles of individual psychology with records of actual political behavior.
            2. It is designed to put together a good deal of what we know about the psychology of deterrence into a rigorous and formal system and thus to serve as an integrating device for that body of knowledge.
            3. It is designed to be used in human games of the type represented by Bloomfield's DETEX games to provide inputs for teams that cannot be staffed with humans and to represent aspects of the environment that are not played out by the human players.
            4. It is designed perhaps ultimately to provide a way of simulating a variety of possible crises. It will be some time before we have enough confidence in the model to use it in such a semi-predictive fashion, but that cannot be ruled out.},

Unfortunately, most scientific papers present a greatly distorted and static image of the true history and sociology of a research project. This paper represents an attempt to report on selected aspects of the actual growth and development of a simulation project, especially as that process affected the development of a novel method for validating simulation models. The paper also represents a philosophical analysis of the concept of simulation, especially as that analysis formed an integral part of the study's development.
            One of the paper's main theses is that the teleology or purpose behind the construction of a simulation model is an ever present task-master guiding and influencing all the phases of a model's construction and validation. A general thesis is that a researcher's philosophy of science is as characteristic of him (i.e., his psychology) as it is of the phenomena he typically studies. The implications of these theses are illustrated in terms of the simulation of the engineering design behavior of a practicing mechanical engineer.},

            Simulation has been used extensively in the management sciences as a complement to more conventional methods of analysis. The procedure has also been applied in analyses of various sectors of the agricultural industry. Simulation can include time lags, nonlinearities, and recursive or reactive effects—without the restrictive assumption of an “optimum” solution. Consequently, it should find increasing application in the study of the effects of farm program alternatives. Simulation is used in this article to portray the workings of an economic model of the U.S. agricultural industry for the years 1930–1960. One simulation describes the levels of key dependent variables throughout the period, as a measure of the model's predictive ability. These results are used to evaluate a second simulation, which assumes no government diversions of commodities or cropland acreage and no payments to farmers.},

Players may learn more about recognizing problems for future attention than about solutions of problems that can be applied in new situations. The kinds and amounts of learning vary with the length of game play, with team success or failure, and with individual job assignment on the team.

@article{whalley_literary_1967,
	title = {Literary {Computing}},
	abstract = {Because machines cannot make value judgments, they cannot
perform literary criticism. But they can bring together and define
materials for reflection and judgment which can allow human critics
to erect structures of great intricacy and originality. The four main
types of such activity are stylistic analysis, which includes the associated operations of word-counting, the formation of word inventories, the study of word-clusters, studies of spelling, the identification
of printers and typesetters, the study of literary influence, and the
identification of pseudonymous and putative authors; the compilation of concordances; the systematic and detailed comparison of the
various drafts, versions, and printing of a literary text with the
presentation of all the variants from a chosen standard text; and
bibliography.
Although most of the standard ways of manipulating the materials
of literary research have been successfully explored by computer,
progress across the whole field has been uneven, and the methods
are difficult to reconcile because of the variety of machines and
computer languages used. The most serious objection is that each
project or program tends to be enclosed within its own conceptua !
aim and its own form of presentation; and most literary projects so
far have had as their end the production of a hand-tool of research.
Among the peculiar difficulties encountered in literary computing
are that the quantity of material to be processed tends to be very
large, and is literal rather than numerical, that the data are in
variable-length records, that judgmental intervention is needed in
varying degrees, and that workers ordinarily are not able to contribute to a large literary project at various levels of skid and
judgment. Furthermore, the literary scholar who wishes to :work
with computers faces the intractability of programmers, the inappropriateness of programming languages, and the mathematically
structured computer which, by forcing an inappropriate analogy of
both "language" and "thinking," tends to become logically circular.
To overcome these, we must not simply put together a family of
literary-editorial programs that will run on a single machine, but
evolve an elegantly coordinated system that will allow quick access
to a number of large data banks so that any of the literary-critical
operations could be used to produce single short-run answers to
single questions, and intermediate and interim correlations, lists, or
substantive index concordance, collation or bibliographical entries
as starting points for further specific critical inquiry. In such an
arrangement, the computer would become, not simply a manufacturer of hand-tools for literary research but an instrument of direct literary inquiry capable of guiding and supporting a sequence of
literary judgments towards some wider or deeper recognition. Once
we can establish the coordinated computer system that will allow
rapid and continuous processing of different kinds of literary materials, we can transcend the limits of computer-structured answers
to computer-structured questions. This system should also provide
for legibility, for a large range of characters in both storing and
printing complex literary data, and for appropriate linkage with
the methods of printing. But there will always have to be systematic
and frequent human intervention in any literary program that is
at all subtle or well sustained, for a scholar may learn in those
interventions how to establish the tactile relations with his material
he has a/ways had in the past.
So far, computing has thrived on ad hoccery, on providing packages for clamorous clients for limited purposes. Machines, languages;
terminology, assumptions, analogies, procedures are all contaminated by limited foresight and bY haste. The application of computer
design to the realities of highly sophisticated literary use of languag e
might well bring us to a new generation of computers. Meanwhile
the literary users of computers must strive to locate and define the
precise areas in which the mathematically based machine is appropriate. (Joseph Raben)},

	abstract = {Roll-call votes are being used increasingly to throw light on various aspects of the legislative process. As long as these votes are neither simply unanimous nor cast purely on party lines, they contain information that can often be rendered more intelligible by the simplification or condensation of many votes into fewer variables or dimensions. The researcher interested in a particular legislative decision can thus profit by seeing whether it exemplifies a more general and repeated type of occurrence. The techniques of analysis used in studying legislative votes are broadly applicable to collegial bodies of many sorts, including municipal, state, and national legislative bodies; party congresses and conventions; the U.S. Supreme Court; and the United Nations General Assembly.
            
              Two major questions have been asked which lead to the search for different kinds of simplifying variables in this analysis. One concerns the
              issues
              that divide a given group of legislators at a given time,
              i.e.
              , what general matters are being argued about? The second concerns the
              subgroups
              of legislators within the group selected for study: what are the blocs, factions, cliques, and the like, whose more persistent existence is reflected by the division on a given vote?},

            Even a cursory examination of data-processing methods currently used in archaeology indicates that there is a great need for a low-cost system that allows the investigator to study large masses of data without abandoning the units of archaeological analysis with which he is familiar. The authors recommend the use of a new system, Termatrex, which is a simple semiautomatic system that involves perforated cards and a light source for information retrieval. Termatrex is an inverted data-recording and searching system, with a virtually unlimited memory, which can be used at a desk. At present, Termatrex is the only system that provides true random access, continuous feedback between the investigator and his data, and compatibility with the standard digital computers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents estimates of the probability that the occurrence of the Paradox of Voting, commonly known as Arrow's Paradox, will prevent the selection of a majority issue when odd-sized committees of
              m
              judges vote upon
              n
              issues. The estimates, obtained through computer simulation of the voting process, indicate that the probability of such an intransitive social ordering is lower than the ratio of intransitive outcomes to all outcomes.
            
            Many of the arguments in political theory and welfare economics dealing with the paradox (e.g., Downs, 1957; Black, 1958; Schubert, 1960) seem to have implicitly assumed that since the paradox exists, its likelihood of occurrence is very close to 1. The results in this paper may call for a re-examination of these positions.},

            Specifically, the following hypotheses will be tested with data from the 1914 crisis leading up to the Great War in Europe:
            
              Hypothesis 1

            (a) time will be perceived as an increasingly salient factor in decision-making.

	abstract = {The art of music composition can be learned to some extent by following the work of composers and by studying the fundamentals of music. Composition can be stimulated by various experiences and may be aided by research. However, the process which operates in the mind of the composer is not understood. Even without such knowledge, it is possible to develop machines which can aid the composer in his search for melody which is the essence of most music. Although the ability to create is a gift, even great composers have at times turned to various aids for assistance. In this connection, random-probability systems allow the generation of sequences of notes in a series which are not completely random nor completely ordered, but each note is selected in a random fashion with a probability which depends upon preceding notes. Such a machine has been developed and has been operated to generate a sequence of an almost infinite series of notes according to trinote probabilities found in the music of Stephen Foster. Combined with sound synthesizers, the machine provides additional instrumentation for the musical laboratory. However, the ultimate output of even the best equipped laboratory still depends upon the composer.},

He seeks to construct a consistent story revealing the fundamental nature and meaning to us of the past, thus creating insight into the past and understanding of it—something considerably beyond a mere account of what probably happened. However, this story must be based upon, and be consistent with, the reconstructed events of the past, “what probably happened.”},

Computers are essentially numerate and increasingly literate but only very unevenly graphicate. This paper explores the nature of the computer barrier in the field of cartography. For this purpose maps are classified as cartogram maps which portray point data, isogram maps which portray line data, morphogram maps which portray area data (shapes), and compound maps which combine two or three of the foregoing types. Cartogram and isogram maps do not present fundamental obstacles to computerisation as they possess the desirable characteristics of numerical input and a low ratio of markings to blank space. Isogram maps also permit interpolations. Morphogram maps are likely to be vastly more complex and the time and cost of feeding in data may far outweigh any savings in analysis and calculation. This class of map is discussed more fully.},

This subject emerged as a distinctive academic discipline in the period 1860–65 and was the direct result of an attempt to apply the concepts of Darwinian evolution to social phenomena. The basic axioms of the subject are thus closely analogous to those of nineteenth‐century botany and zoology. Words like ‘tribe’, ‘people’, ‘society’, ‘culture’ have been confused with the more biological concept ‘race’ and have commonly been used as if they had the qualities of Linnaean ‘species’;
              i.e.
              they are assumed to denote entities which are fully discrete and self‐perpetuating, each with its own distinct evolutionary history. There is also a tacit assumption that any such entity, when recorded by the anthropologist, is in a stable condition. Given these assumptions it becomes meaningful to attempt a systematic taxonomy of entities based in some regular principle of monothetic division. Such a taxonomy will of necessity be of a pyramidal segmentary type, such as the following:},
