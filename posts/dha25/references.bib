	abstract = {Simulation is a technique for building theories that reproduce part or all of the output of a behaving system. The system can be an aggregate of behaving units, an entire economy, or a particular unit, a human decision-maker. The article, outlines some methods for using simulation to study various aspects of an economic system. The article places special emphasis on microeconomic simulation, especially the simulation of individual economic actors and individual firms. Simulation appears to offer new approaches to the aggregation problem. To the extent that whole classes of individual decision units in the economy share relatively invariant structures, aggregation can be attempted by writing programs for individual units, and treating these as representative units. One of its attractions lies in the new opportunities it affords for direct confrontation of the theory with concrete behavior. It does not restrict to viewing the economic system through the wrong end of a telescope-limiting people to census data and similar kinds of statistics.},

	annote = {There is a particularly fine section on 'distribution and meaning'. Problems with mapping word distributions onto meaning distributions:

What we mean is clearly related to the physical world we occupy, and yet the structures of language do not seem to coincide with the structure of the world. (p. 151)
We can mean many different things, and change our minds considerably, without altering the language we use. (p. 151)
Each individual word or morpheme can have many different, often quite unrelated meanings in many different contexts—thus the distribution of this word cannot be seen as the distribution of its meaning. (p. 152)

But, the key point: 'The correlation between language and meaning is much stronger when we consider connected discourse' (p. 152)
A new notion of 'environment' (p. 153), as the set of other morphemes/phonemes with which a particular morpheme/phoneme occurs.
Harris also considers the possibility of 'distribution as a function of meaning'. To explain the idea, he imagines an experiment: give a person a sentence, and ask them to exchange one of the words in it. What word would they pick? E.g. 'The oculist prescribed me a different set of glasses.' An informant might swap 'oculist' for 'optometrist' or 'opthamologist', but would be very unlikely to swap it for 'of', 'lemon' or 'e.g.'. (pp. 156-7)
A key underlying principle is that language is productive, or rather produced. There is a conditional probability of a given word being produced in a given linguistic context.
*pp. 157-8 – Again the importance of 'discourse' to distributional analysis. – In the footnote on p. 158, he suggests that each discourse will have its own characteristic 'distributional regularities'.

	abstract = {Since the nineteenth century, American geographers have applied mathematical concepts to geographic research, and they have increased the level of mathematical sophistication associated with their research. To some extent geographers have traditionally been interested in developing methods of quantitative geographic analysis; however, it was not until the turn of the twentieth century that there was concentrated effort to develop special programs of quantitative methods training and to expand the scope of quantitative geographic research. This paper attempts to examine certain aspects of expansion of quantitative methods training and research for the period 1954-1965. Since the early 1950's the number of major geography departments offering specialized training in quantitative methodology has risen from three percent to over seventy-eight percent. Today many departments require training in statistics and mathematics and roughly one third of the major American doctoral training centers now allow their students to substitute mathematics training for one foreign language requirement. This trend is paralleled by an increasingly large number of quantitative dissertations and quantitative research papers found in a sample of the major geographic journals. Our studies indicate that these trends originated at the University of Washington, and certain Midwestern universities, but after a short period of time, the quantitative revolution spread throughout American geographic centers.},

	abstract = {Since in geographical research it is often necessary to handle large amounts of information, data-processing techniques have many advantages. Many problems can be solved more quickly and more cheaply, and in addition, exercises can be carried out which have so far been beyond the reach of conventional techniques. More specifically, the computer can undertake descriptive mapping, spatial analysis and the running of process models. A necessary condition for the adoption on a larger scale of automatic data-processing in geography is that census information should be made available with due regard to the spatial element. The tradition of providing data only for political areas gives a quite inadequate degree of geographical precision and flexibility. In Sweden, experiments have been carried out with the aim of developing a national data-bank system possessing a high degree of geographical precision. The system is now under Government consideration with a view to implementing it in time for the 1970 census. Public land-registration forms the general base. The principle is to select a 'central point' (normally the main building) inside each cadastral unit. This point is taken to represent the location of the entire unit, and its x-y co-ordinates in the national grid are entered in the land-register to the nearest 10 metres. Since all census data are referred to the cadastral units, the land-register tape will provide a translation device for purposes of mapping. A set of examples is shown to demonstrate descriptive mapping and computerized spatial analysis. It is often convenient and useful to aggregate data over square cells, but this procedure is by no means a necessary feature of the system. Distance zones from a point or line and completely irregular regions are equally possible, as well as straightforward plotting of dots. Samples can be drawn with full regard to ecological conditions. Data-banks storing geographical information, together with the use of computers, would greatly improve our ability to tackle complex regional situations quantitatively.},

The general term encompasses these disciplines insofar as they are not straightforwardly natural sciences but have affinities with the humanities. This often supports interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary projects. This chapter explains these usages. More substantially, it argues that the many dimensions of the human subject give value to a heading under which to debate the relation of different approaches to knowledge and practice associated with differences between the natural science, social sciences, and humanities.

The availability of computer programs for data processing has made it possible to search for salient issues by examining all the roll-call votes in a given Congress, rather than limiting analysis to pre-selected subsets of votes reflecting the judgment of the investigator. One particularly promising set of computer programs for this purpose is the BC TRY system, designed by R. C. Tryon. The purpose of the present paper is to illustrate the applicability of this system to roll-call analysis. 
Various procedures of multivariate analysis are applicable to the identification of legislative issues from roll calls. These include Guttman scaling, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Computer programs are available for these procedures and several versions of them can be performed by particular programs in the BC TRY system. We select for presentation the procedure of non-communality cluster analysis, which is not widely available outside the BC TRY system, and which also has the advantage of making fewer assumptions about communalities than other methods. In addition we present the spherical analysis (SPAN) diagram, which can be computed for any three-dimensional factor space identified by the system. To illustrate these features, we shall use the votes of the Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 84th Congress (1955-56).},

Diverse applications of computer models in social science are discussed, along with a validation study involving HOMUNCULUS, a computer model of social behavior. Hypotheses concerning decision making in a role-conflict dilemma were stated operationally as computer routines compatible with HOMUNCULUS. In computer runs using input data from actual questionnaires, alternative formulations regarding role conflict resolution were tested. Since the data generated by each run represented the logical consequences of the hypotheses operating in that run, it was possible to assess the adequacy of each programmed formulation by comparing the simulated responses with the actual decisions of living respondents. Such flexibility and dynamic capacity are major benefits accruing from testing a social theory through computer simulation.},

	abstract = {Much of the business of the U.S. Congress in the post war period has involved issues concerning the size and scope of activities of the federal government. The legislation in this area can be traced, for the most part, to measures which originated during the period of the New Deal in response to the Great Depression and to measures enacted during World War II to meet the short-run exigencies attendant to rapid economic and social mobilization. From the point of view of the expansion of the federal role, the Eisenhower years are of some moment. While they marked a lull in the expansionist trend witnessed under the Democratic presidencies of Roosevelt and Truman, their significance lies in the fact that despite the change in adminsitrations, there was no reversal of the policies begun during the Roosevelt years. While most of the Republican legislators were on record in opposition to the expansion of the federal role, the failure of the Republican Party to introduce and enact legislation to reverse the trend of federal expansion resulted in a new plateau of federal activity from which the congressional dialogue was to proceed during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.
            
              While the 87th Congress, meeting during Kennedy's first two years in the White House, did not enact the quantity of legislation expanding the federal role that Kennedy had called for in his inaugural, In the 88th Congress both parties supported a larger federal role to a greater extent than they had previously. In fact the first sessions of the 88th Congress as it bears on the federal role has been summed up as follows: “At no time did the majority of both parties reject a larger federal role.” (
              Congressional Quarterly Almanac
              , 1963, p. 724) With two exceptions, the statement holds true for the second session in 1964.},

	abstract = {A Monte Carlo model was devised for simulation of human tracking behavior with a digital computer. The model had four basic equations and included provision for one- and two-dimensional tracking, repetitive and irregular input signals, and practice trials. Four groups of 12 human subjects each were given 40 practice trials on either one- or two-dimensional tracking, and either repetitive or irregular input signals. The model was then used to simulate corresponding data for four groups of 12 hypothetical subjects each, and comparisons of the real and hypothetical subject samples were made for various measures of proficiency. Overall, the adequacy of the simulation was judged as good. Research tactics are discussed for arriving at a generalized model of n-dimensional tracking behavior, and for elaborated models that will include procedural and decision acts to simulate more complex man-machine systems.},

The first is an attempt to describe characteristics common to many system simulations; the second is a discussion of some problems involved in the construction of a digital simulator; and the third concerns problems that arise in the use of such a simulator.},

            1. It is designed to increase our understanding of the process of deterrence by exploring how far the behavior of political decision makers in crisis can be explained by psychological mechanisms. This is done by comparing the output of the highly simplified computer model based on principles of individual psychology with records of actual political behavior.
            2. It is designed to put together a good deal of what we know about the psychology of deterrence into a rigorous and formal system and thus to serve as an integrating device for that body of knowledge.
            3. It is designed to be used in human games of the type represented by Bloomfield's DETEX games to provide inputs for teams that cannot be staffed with humans and to represent aspects of the environment that are not played out by the human players.
            4. It is designed perhaps ultimately to provide a way of simulating a variety of possible crises. It will be some time before we have enough confidence in the model to use it in such a semi-predictive fashion, but that cannot be ruled out.},

Unfortunately, most scientific papers present a greatly distorted and static image of the true history and sociology of a research project. This paper represents an attempt to report on selected aspects of the actual growth and development of a simulation project, especially as that process affected the development of a novel method for validating simulation models. The paper also represents a philosophical analysis of the concept of simulation, especially as that analysis formed an integral part of the study's development.
            One of the paper's main theses is that the teleology or purpose behind the construction of a simulation model is an ever present task-master guiding and influencing all the phases of a model's construction and validation. A general thesis is that a researcher's philosophy of science is as characteristic of him (i.e., his psychology) as it is of the phenomena he typically studies. The implications of these theses are illustrated in terms of the simulation of the engineering design behavior of a practicing mechanical engineer.},

            Simulation has been used extensively in the management sciences as a complement to more conventional methods of analysis. The procedure has also been applied in analyses of various sectors of the agricultural industry. Simulation can include time lags, nonlinearities, and recursive or reactive effects—without the restrictive assumption of an “optimum” solution. Consequently, it should find increasing application in the study of the effects of farm program alternatives. Simulation is used in this article to portray the workings of an economic model of the U.S. agricultural industry for the years 1930–1960. One simulation describes the levels of key dependent variables throughout the period, as a measure of the model's predictive ability. These results are used to evaluate a second simulation, which assumes no government diversions of commodities or cropland acreage and no payments to farmers.},

Players may learn more about recognizing problems for future attention than about solutions of problems that can be applied in new situations. The kinds and amounts of learning vary with the length of game play, with team success or failure, and with individual job assignment on the team.

@article{whalley_literary_1967,
	title = {Literary {Computing}},
	abstract = {Because machines cannot make value judgments, they cannot
perform literary criticism. But they can bring together and define
materials for reflection and judgment which can allow human critics
to erect structures of great intricacy and originality. The four main
types of such activity are stylistic analysis, which includes the associated operations of word-counting, the formation of word inventories, the study of word-clusters, studies of spelling, the identification
of printers and typesetters, the study of literary influence, and the
identification of pseudonymous and putative authors; the compilation of concordances; the systematic and detailed comparison of the
various drafts, versions, and printing of a literary text with the
presentation of all the variants from a chosen standard text; and
bibliography.
Although most of the standard ways of manipulating the materials
of literary research have been successfully explored by computer,
progress across the whole field has been uneven, and the methods
are difficult to reconcile because of the variety of machines and
computer languages used. The most serious objection is that each
project or program tends to be enclosed within its own conceptua !
aim and its own form of presentation; and most literary projects so
far have had as their end the production of a hand-tool of research.
Among the peculiar difficulties encountered in literary computing
are that the quantity of material to be processed tends to be very
large, and is literal rather than numerical, that the data are in
variable-length records, that judgmental intervention is needed in
varying degrees, and that workers ordinarily are not able to contribute to a large literary project at various levels of skid and
judgment. Furthermore, the literary scholar who wishes to :work
with computers faces the intractability of programmers, the inappropriateness of programming languages, and the mathematically
structured computer which, by forcing an inappropriate analogy of
both "language" and "thinking," tends to become logically circular.
To overcome these, we must not simply put together a family of
literary-editorial programs that will run on a single machine, but
evolve an elegantly coordinated system that will allow quick access
to a number of large data banks so that any of the literary-critical
operations could be used to produce single short-run answers to
single questions, and intermediate and interim correlations, lists, or
substantive index concordance, collation or bibliographical entries
as starting points for further specific critical inquiry. In such an
arrangement, the computer would become, not simply a manufacturer of hand-tools for literary research but an instrument of direct literary inquiry capable of guiding and supporting a sequence of
literary judgments towards some wider or deeper recognition. Once
we can establish the coordinated computer system that will allow
rapid and continuous processing of different kinds of literary materials, we can transcend the limits of computer-structured answers
to computer-structured questions. This system should also provide
for legibility, for a large range of characters in both storing and
printing complex literary data, and for appropriate linkage with
the methods of printing. But there will always have to be systematic
and frequent human intervention in any literary program that is
at all subtle or well sustained, for a scholar may learn in those
interventions how to establish the tactile relations with his material
he has a/ways had in the past.
So far, computing has thrived on ad hoccery, on providing packages for clamorous clients for limited purposes. Machines, languages;
terminology, assumptions, analogies, procedures are all contaminated by limited foresight and bY haste. The application of computer
design to the realities of highly sophisticated literary use of languag e
might well bring us to a new generation of computers. Meanwhile
the literary users of computers must strive to locate and define the
precise areas in which the mathematically based machine is appropriate. (Joseph Raben)},

	abstract = {Roll-call votes are being used increasingly to throw light on various aspects of the legislative process. As long as these votes are neither simply unanimous nor cast purely on party lines, they contain information that can often be rendered more intelligible by the simplification or condensation of many votes into fewer variables or dimensions. The researcher interested in a particular legislative decision can thus profit by seeing whether it exemplifies a more general and repeated type of occurrence. The techniques of analysis used in studying legislative votes are broadly applicable to collegial bodies of many sorts, including municipal, state, and national legislative bodies; party congresses and conventions; the U.S. Supreme Court; and the United Nations General Assembly.
            
              Two major questions have been asked which lead to the search for different kinds of simplifying variables in this analysis. One concerns the
              issues
              that divide a given group of legislators at a given time,
              i.e.
              , what general matters are being argued about? The second concerns the
              subgroups
              of legislators within the group selected for study: what are the blocs, factions, cliques, and the like, whose more persistent existence is reflected by the division on a given vote?},

Such perspectives not infrequently require both a combination of methodologies and a critical appraisal of the limitations of each. The emergence of American voting-behavior studies over the last two decades constitutes a good case in point. Studies based on aggregate election statistics have given us invaluable insights into the nature of secular trends in the distribution of the party vote, and have also provided us with useful theory concerning such major phenomena as critical elections. Survey research has made significant contributions to the understanding of motivational forces at work upon the individual voter. As it matures, it is now reaching out to grapple with problems which involve the political system as a whole.},

It approved the income tax, reintroduced by Peel in 1842, and the Poor Law, which was renewed in 1842 and again in 1847. It discussed and voted upon, though it was far from approving, proposals for the extension of the franchise, the adoption of the secret ballot and the restriction of the special legal privileges of landowners. There were divisions as well on various aspects of the Irish question, religious questions and the position of the Church of England, army reform, fiscal reform and other matters.},

            Even a cursory examination of data-processing methods currently used in archaeology indicates that there is a great need for a low-cost system that allows the investigator to study large masses of data without abandoning the units of archaeological analysis with which he is familiar. The authors recommend the use of a new system, Termatrex, which is a simple semiautomatic system that involves perforated cards and a light source for information retrieval. Termatrex is an inverted data-recording and searching system, with a virtually unlimited memory, which can be used at a desk. At present, Termatrex is the only system that provides true random access, continuous feedback between the investigator and his data, and compatibility with the standard digital computers.},

	abstract = {Of the many excellent studies of Congress completed by political scientists in recent years, few, if any, suggest a departure from Woodrow Wilson's apt phrase, “Congressional government is Committee government.” Despite numerous efforts to analyze legislative action in terms of roll call votes, constituency characteristics, state delegations, and/or specialized interest blocs, the committee system remains the central focal point of congressional behavior and organization. Thus, if Wilson's nineteenth century insight is still valid, then it would seem that more intensive studies of the congressional committee system—in the manner employed by Huitt and Fenno, for example—would yield many new relevant facts concerning the complexities of the legislative process.
            As a case in point, the manner in which individual members of Congress are assigned to various committees has been well covered by Matthews, Clapp, and Masters. The situation in the Senate is such that each member carries at least two, and in many instances three standing committee assignments. In the House, the maximum standing committee work-load is two assignments, although most Representatives have only a single committee responsibility. However, in connection with this latter point, if one examines the standing committee assignments of all House members for the first session of every Congress from the 80th through the 89th, an interesting pattern emerges in which a gradual but steady increase in the number of double committee assignments is clearly evidenced during the past twenty years.},

	abstract = {The president's difficulties in inducing Congress to pass his legislative program are usually ascribed to the different constituencies of the two institutions. This difference would make for disharmony under any circumstances, but it is said to be particularly important because the seniority system bestows the most power on congressmen whose constituencies are most unlike the president's. His policy commitments are responses to the needs of a heterogeneous, industrialized, urban society. The occupants of the most influential congressional positions come from districts that re-elect them regardless of national political trends. The representative from such a district “views with alarm the great issues that sweep the nation and threaten to disrupt the familiar and comfortable politics of his district,” which is usually characterized as a rural backwater.
            Both political parties are described this way. Because the Democrats have controlled Congress for all but four of the past 36 years, most illustrations of this thesis are drawn from conflicts between Democratic presidents and Democratic congresses. More specifically, the focus of attention is usually on the refusal of southern Democratic congressional leaders to support presidential legislative requests.},

The other is to classify all such members of the system according to their attributed importance or status during the same period.

              e.g.
              , bloc cluster analysis and Guttman scale procedures) to legislative politics have sharply improved the ability of political scientists to specify significant dimensions of voting behavior. Party affiliation, constituency characteristics and cohesion within state delegations have been correlated with the congressional vote in a number of subject matter areas. Because of the masses of data to be handled, however, even the best of these studies have been limited in scope to a single year or to one Congress. This restriction has not prevented the authors of these works from demonstrating clearly the utility of their methodology, but it has limited correspondingly either the generality or the reliability of their conclusions. The present study, limited to the single issue of congressional voting on foreign aid, is an attempt to discover, by the application of quantitative methods to votes over longer time periods, how far the relationships previously suggested persist over time or are peculiar to the individual sessions in which they occur.},

              judges vote upon
              n
              issues. The estimates, obtained through computer simulation of the voting process, indicate that the probability of such an intransitive social ordering is lower than the ratio of intransitive outcomes to all outcomes.
            
            Many of the arguments in political theory and welfare economics dealing with the paradox (e.g., Downs, 1957; Black, 1958; Schubert, 1960) seem to have implicitly assumed that since the paradox exists, its likelihood of occurrence is very close to 1. The results in this paper may call for a re-examination of these positions.},

The coded record, is produced by a musician, musical engineer, or composer with a fundamental understanding of the composition of sound. The electronic music synthesizer provides means for the production of a tone with any frequency, intensity, growth, duration, decay, portamento, timbre, vibrato, and variation. If these properties of a tone are specified, the tone can be completely described. The advantage of the electronic music synthesizer is that it can produce new and radical tone complexes for musical satisfaction and gratification. The new system does not displace the artist and musician of today. It does not take the place of talent combined with work. The electronic music synthesizer provides the musician, musical engineer, and composer with a new musical tool with no inherent physical limitations.},

	abstract = {The art of music composition can be learned to some extent by following the work of composers and by studying the fundamentals of music. Composition can be stimulated by various experiences and may be aided by research. However, the process which operates in the mind of the composer is not understood. Even without such knowledge, it is possible to develop machines which can aid the composer in his search for melody which is the essence of most music. Although the ability to create is a gift, even great composers have at times turned to various aids for assistance. In this connection, random-probability systems allow the generation of sequences of notes in a series which are not completely random nor completely ordered, but each note is selected in a random fashion with a probability which depends upon preceding notes. Such a machine has been developed and has been operated to generate a sequence of an almost infinite series of notes according to trinote probabilities found in the music of Stephen Foster. Combined with sound synthesizers, the machine provides additional instrumentation for the musical laboratory. However, the ultimate output of even the best equipped laboratory still depends upon the composer.},

He seeks to construct a consistent story revealing the fundamental nature and meaning to us of the past, thus creating insight into the past and understanding of it—something considerably beyond a mere account of what probably happened. However, this story must be based upon, and be consistent with, the reconstructed events of the past, “what probably happened.”},

Computers are essentially numerate and increasingly literate but only very unevenly graphicate. This paper explores the nature of the computer barrier in the field of cartography. For this purpose maps are classified as cartogram maps which portray point data, isogram maps which portray line data, morphogram maps which portray area data (shapes), and compound maps which combine two or three of the foregoing types. Cartogram and isogram maps do not present fundamental obstacles to computerisation as they possess the desirable characteristics of numerical input and a low ratio of markings to blank space. Isogram maps also permit interpolations. Morphogram maps are likely to be vastly more complex and the time and cost of feeding in data may far outweigh any savings in analysis and calculation. This class of map is discussed more fully.},

	abstract = {Much that has been said by other speakers is applicable also to Social Anthropology. This subject emerged as a distinctive academic discipline in the period 1860–65 and was the direct result of an attempt to apply the concepts of Darwinian evolution to social phenomena. The basic axioms of the subject are thus closely analogous to those of nineteenth‐century botany and zoology. Words like ‘tribe’, ‘people’, ‘society’, ‘culture’ have been confused with the more biological concept ‘race’ and have commonly been used as if they had the qualities of Linnaean ‘species’;
              i.e.

There is also a tacit assumption that any such entity, when recorded by the anthropologist, is in a stable condition. Given these assumptions it becomes meaningful to attempt a systematic taxonomy of entities based in some regular principle of monothetic division. Such a taxonomy will of necessity be of a pyramidal segmentary type, such as the following:},

If at all, these narratives can only be grasped and examined from a somewhat detached perspective. Here, we attempt to investigate these elusive narratives by means of a conceptual history approach. In doing so, we define different theory dimensions, ranging from specific cultural and literary theory frameworks to more generic uses of the concept of \_theory\_. We examine the use and semantic changes of these theory notions in a large corpus of DH journals. Using a mixture of heuristic methods and approaches from the field of distributional semantics, we aim to create tellable conceptual stories of DH theory.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Most commentators locate the origin of digital humanities (DH) in computational text analysis of the mid-twentieth century, beginning in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the Index Thomisticus, a massive attempt to encode nearly 11 million words of Thomas Aquinas’ writings on IBM punch cards. This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work ‘concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)’ (Presner, 2010, p. 6). Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)—and misguided in its approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does not depend on digital technology.
            This article presents an empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types, authors’ disciplines and locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as well as broader trends in the early history of the field.},

Such research, however, requires ample attention to what scientists in specific settings understood epistemic virtues to mean. Although the adjective refers to their role in facilitating the pursuit of epistemic aims (knowledge and understanding of reality), epistemic virtues are often imbued with moral, social, religious, and/or political meaning. If virtues specify the character traits marking a “scientific self,” then scientific selfhood is never exclusively defined in epistemic terms.},

Erste Studie: Der Gegenstand der Kulturwissenschaft
17 – Facts are not atomic: “Es gibt keine ‘nackten’ Fakta – keine Tatsachen, die anders als im Hinblick auf bestimmt begriffliche Voraussetzungen und mit ihrer Hilfe feststellbar sind. Jede Konstatierung von Tatsachen ist nur in einem betstimmten Urteils-Zusammenhang möglich, der seinerseits auf gewissen logischen Bedingungen beruht.” – He goes on to claim that the fact-value distinction is an Empiricist dogma rather than a philosophically respectable position.
18 – Pure intuition as the ‘matter’ of beauty: “Plastik, Malerei, Architektur scheinen einen gemeinsamed Gegenstand zu haben.Es scheint die allbefassende ‘reine Anschauung’ des Raumes zu sein, die in ihnen zur Darstellung gelangt. Und doch ist der malerische, der plastiche, der architektonische Raum nicht ‘derselbe’; sondern in jedem von ihnen drückt sich je eine spezifisch-eigene Art der Auffassung, des räumlichen ‘Sehens’ aus.”
19 – Philosophy should abandon the ‘object’ and instead understand the ‘unity of function’, i.e. phenomenology: “An die Stelle der einheit des Objekts ist hier die Einheit der Funktion getreten. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, braucht die Philosophie mit den besonderen Wissenschaften nicht mehr auf deren eigenem Gebiet zu wetteifern. Sie kann diesen ihre volle Autonomie, ihre Freiheit und Selbstgesetzgebung lassen.” – Like Oakeshott, Cassirer is a strong proponent of incommensurability.
26 – Fundamental statement of Cassier’s symbolist position: “Dies alles verändert sich grundlegen, sobald wir in den Kreis des menschlichen Handelns eintreten. Dieses ist, selbst in seinen einfachsten und primitivisten Formen, durch eine Art der ‘Mittelbarkeit’ gekennzeichnet, die der Weise, in der das Tier reagiert, scharf entgegengesetzt ist. […] Diese ‘Vorstellung’ des Künftigen charakterisiert alles menschliche Handeln. Wir müssen ein noch nicht Bestehendes im ‘Bilde’ vor uns hinstellen, um sodann von dieser ‘Möglichkeit’ zur ‘Wirklichkeit’, von der Potenz zum Akt überzugehen.”
31 – All perception is aesthetic perception: “In dieser Hinsicht konnte Goethe mit Recht sagen, daß der Stil auf den tiefsten Grundfesten der Erkenntnis ruhe, auf dem Wesen der Dinge, insofern uns erlaubt ist, es in sichtbaren und greiflichen Gestalten zu erkennen.”
32 – Cassirer’s theory of lyric: “Auch der scheinbar ‘subjektivisten’ Kunst, auch der Lyrik ist dieser Zug eigentümlich. Mehr als jede andere Kunstgattung scheint die Lyrik dem Augenblick verhaftet zu sein. Das lyrische Gedicht will eine einmalige, flüchtige, nie wiederkehrende Stimmung gewissermaßen im Fluge erhaschen und festhalten.”
Zweite Studie: Dingwahrnehmung und Ausdruckswahrnehmung
34 – “Die innere Krise, in der sich die Philosophie and die Wissenschaft in den letzten hundert Jahren, in der Zeit seit Goethes und Hegels Tod, befunden hat, tritt vielleicht in keinem anderen Zug so deutlich hervor wie in dem Verhältnis, das hier zwischen Naturwissenschaft und Kulturwissenschaft bestand.” – Both branches of knowledge have made considerable progress – “Aber allen diesen Triumphen, die das Wissen im Laufe eines einzigen Jahrhunderts zu erreichen vermochte, stand ein schwerer Mangel und ein innerer Shaden gegenüber. Wenn die Forschung in jedem Teilgebiet unaufhaltsam fortschreited konnte, so wurde doch ihre innere Einheit immer fragwürdiger.”
Critique of Windelband
36 – Windelband proposed a methodological distinction between NW and KW: “Windelbands Theorie sieht in dem Gegensatz zwischen Naturwissenschaft und Geschichte keinen Gegensatz der Weltanschauung, sondern eine solche der Methoden.”
36 – Problem – all research is both idiographic and nomothetic: “Die Grenzen, die die Theorie zu ziehen genötigt ist, werden in dieser Arbeit immer wieder verwischt; statt der beiden klar gesonderten Extreme finden wir zumeist nur irgenwelche Misch- und Übergangsformen.”
39 – It is necessary to analyse scientific experience in order to resolve the NW/KW question. Again kind of like Oakeshott… “Die Analyse der Begriffsform als solcher kann die spezifische Differenz, die zwischen Naturwissenschaft und Kulturwissenschaft besteht, nicht vollständig aufhellen. Wir müssen uns vielmehr entschließen, den Hebel noch tiefer anzusetzen. Wir müssen uns der Phänomenologie der Wahrnehmung anvertrauen und fragen, was sie uns für uzer Problem zu geben hat.”
*39 – There are two modes of intentionality: “Es gibt keine Wahrnehmung, die nicht einen bestimmten ‘Gegenstand’ meint und auf ihn gerichtet ist. Aber deiser notwendige objektive Bezug stellt sich uns in einer zweifachen Richtung dar, die wir, kurz und schematisch, als die Richtung auf das ‘Es’ und als die Richtung auf das ‘Du’ bezeichnen können. […] Das ‘Es’ ist ein anderes schlechthin, ein aliud; das ‘Du’ ist ein alter ego.”
43 – Cultural objects are distiguishes from physical objects by their functionality: “Auf der anderen Seite aber erscheint in ihm eben das Physische selbst in einer neuen Funktion. Es ‘ist’ und ‘wird’ nicht nur, sondern in diesem Sein und Werden ercheint ein anderes. Dieses Erscheinen eines ‘Sinnes’, der nicht vom Physischen abgelöst ist, sondern an ihm und in ihm verkörpert ist, ist das gemeinsame Moment aller jener Inhalte, die wir mit dem Namen ‘Kultur’ bezeichnen.”
51 – Human express themselves in actions. (Influence on Arendt?) “Denn all Kulturformen, so verschieden sie voneinander auch sein mögen, sind aktive Ausdrucksformen. Sie sind nicht einfache Geschehnisse, die sich in uns und an und abspielen, sondern sie sind sozusagen spezifische Energien, und durch den Einsatz dieser Energien baut sich für uns die Welt der Kultur, die Welt der Sprache, der Kunst, der Religion auf.”
53 – All thinking is dialogic. We build common worlds. “Und in diesem Doppelprozeß baut sich erst der Gedanke selbst auf. Platon hat gesagt, daß es zur Welt der ‘Idee’ keinen anderen Zugang gebe, als daß wir ‘einander Rede stehen in Frage und Antwort’. In Frage und Antwort müssen ‘Ich’ und ‘Du’ sich teilen, um damit nicht nur einander, sondern auch sich selbst zu verstehen.”
Dritte Studie. Naturbegriffe und Kulturbegriffe
58 – Every humanistic science is necessarily systematic. This systematicity is clearly related to Cassirer’s definition of ‘Wissenschaft’ below. “Jede besondere Kulturwissenschaft bildet bestimmte Form- und Stilbegriffe aus und benützt dieselben zu einem systematischen Überblick, zu einer Klassifikation und Unterscheidung der Erscheinungen, von denen sie handelt.” – This conceptual structure, Cassirer goes on to show, is neither ‘idiographic’ nor ‘nomothetic’. 
64 – Cassirer tries to prove that judgements of form are not judgements of value: “Wenn Wölfflin von ‘Klassik’ und ‘Barock’ spricht, so haben beide Begriffe für ihn lediglich eine deskriptive, keine ästhetisch-qualifizierende oder normierende Bedeutung. Mit dem ersten Begriff soll keineswegs der Nebensinn des Vorbildlichen oder Mustergültigen verbunden werden.” – I’m not convinced by this. Isn’t there necessarily an evaluation of how well a given artwork illustrates the “baroque” or “classical” style? Surely these kinds of judgements implicitly value artworks for their periodicity. Certainly this has been one of the big issues in my own area of Romanticism. It is definitely better for a work to be ‘Romantic’ if it was penned between 1780 and 1830 in England! Otherwise it must be either old-fashioned or idiosyncratic.
*69 – The definition of ‘Wissenschaft’? “Wir verstehen eine Wissenschaft in ihrer logischen Struktur erst dann, wenn wir uns klargemacht haben, in welcher Weise sie die Subsumtion des Besonderen unter das Allgemeine vollzieht.”
*73 – How a “Kulturbegriff” extends or perfects a judgement: “Es ist eine Einheit der Richtung, nicht eine Einheit des Seins, die damit zum Ausdruck gebracht werden soll. Die einzelnen Individuen gehören zusammen – nicht weil sie einander gleichen oder ähnlich sind, sondern weil sie an einer gemeinsamen Aufgabe mitwirken, die wir gegenüber dem Mittelalter als neu, and wir als den eigentümlichen ‘Sinn’ der Renaissance empfinden.” – Does this mesh with Collingwood’s re-enactment idea? All human action is purposeful. A cultural concept helps you to see the ‘project’ on which a group of people were embarked with their various works and deeds…
75 – “Je weiter die Kultur sich
