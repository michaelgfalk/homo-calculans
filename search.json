    "text": "What are the “Human Sciences”? How have they been “computerised”? Both questions have an antique ring. In Australia, where I live and work, no-one calls themself a “human scientist,” except perhaps for the odd biologist or psychologist. And in our “digital” age, terms such as “digitisation,” “digitalisation” or “digital transformation” are far more popular than the old term “computerisation,” which smacks of dusty punch-cards and clunking microcomputers from 1980s schoolrooms.\nAnd yet the question, “how were the human sciences computerised,” is an essential one. Today, computing is more humanistic than ever. The Generative AI revolution has suddenly narrowed the perceived gap between humans and machines. Meanwhile, the growth of surveillance capitalism has made the collection and analysis of human data into a big business and a socio-political nightmare. Now we all have an interest in the question: What can we learn about human beings through the use of computation?\nIn this project, I want to take the question back to the beginning. I want to take it back to the 1950s and 60s, when fast digital computers were brand new, and scholars of humankind were only just getting their hands on them. In those days, the concept of the “computer” was fresh. The metaphors people used to describe computers were live. The arguments people made about the possible applications of computing were wild and often utopian. If we go back to that more creative age, we might be able to reopen that creativity, and address the problems of today.\nThis is a pilot project, that will unfold over the course of 2025. Stay tuned, to learn about how humans were datafied in the early days, and to discover new old ways to harness the power of computation to achieve the age-old goal of the human sciences: a gentler, more philsophical, more enlightened understanding of our plural condition on this fragile earth."

    "text": "Welcome to Homo Calculans, a project run by Michael Falk at the University of Melbourne.\nThe overall aim of the project is to assess how researchers in the Human Sciences adopted computational research methods in the first two decades of electronic computing. To do this, the project will pose three research questions about early Computational Human Sciences (CHS):\nRQ1. What were the central methods of study across the different disciplines?\nRQ2. How did scholars explain and justify their new methods? What rhetorical or affective devices did they use to obtain acceptance for their results?\nRQ3. How can this history help us understand the breadth of CHS today?\nThese questions have been asked of individual disciplines, but never of the Human Sciences as a whole. Historians have described the ‘quantitative revolution’ in Geography, the ‘cognitive revolution’ in Psychology, the rise of ‘simulation’ in Economics, and the emergence of ‘humanities computing’ in Literature, History and Linguistics (Gyuris, Michel, and Paulus 2022; Smith 1997; Morgan 2004; Jones 2016) – but to date no scholar has attempted a synoptic view of how computer methods affected research across the Human Sciences. Today, CHS has divided into two main fields: Computational Social Sciences (CSS) and Digital Humanities (DH). But this bifurcation fails to capture the full breadth of computational research today, and overlooks the way early practitioners of CHS such as J.C. Gardin, Herb Simon and P.J. Stone straddled the disciplines. A fresh look at this early period will help to reopen the walled gardens of DH and CSS.\nTo answer the research questions, I will assemble a corpus of early research publications in CHS, and study them using both close reading and corpus analysis. Thus the project is innovative in two respects: (1) in its comparative approach; and (2) in its use of digital methods. While comparative research is not new in the history of the Human Sciences, this project will be the first to compare computational methods across the Human Sciences in the first age of computing; and while it is becoming more common for scholars to digitally analyse corpora of academic articles as evidence in intellectual history (Jordanous and Keller 2016; Sula and Hill 2019; Falk 2024), this remains a young and fast-moving area with ample scope for methodological innovation.\nThe project will lead to a demonstrable conceptual advance because of its original research question and innovative methods. It will elucidate, for the first time, how the Human Sciences fared in the first two decades of electronic computing, using computational methods to observe how the very language of the Human Sciences changed to register the impact of the computer.\nHomo Calculans is funded by an ECR Grant at the University of Melbourne (2025ECRG089).\nImage: CSIRAC (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer), Australia’s first digital computer, and the fourth stored program computer in the world.

    "text": "Which disciplines are represented?\nWho was doing this research in the 1950s and 60s? Which disciplines were at the forefront? We were hoping to be able to give crisp, empirical answers to these questions, but the literature turned out to be so large that is has proven hard to sample the population. For now, we can just see which disciplines appear to be represented in the corpus that we have.\nNiles tagged the items in Zotero, which is great because it is flexible, but not so great because the tags are unstructured. First we need to sort the tags into two groups: discipline tags and technology tags.\n\n\nCode\n# Get list of tags for categorisation\ncorpus |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::distinct(tag) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(tag_category = \"\") |&gt; \n  readr::write_csv(\"all-tags.csv\")\n\n# Import categorised tags\ntag_categories &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"all-tags-categorised.csv\")\n\n\nOnce we have (very roughly) categorised the tags, we can take a look at the summary statistics. Figure 2 shows the disciplines represented in the corpus. The corpus already suggests new lines of inquiry. The social science disciplines are not so surprising, but it is intriguing to note the presence of many Visual Arts and Musiology articles. These disciplines do not feature heavily in the mainstream historiography of Digital Humanities, which has tended to focus on early efforts in literature and linguistics.\n\n\nCode\ndisciplines &lt;- corpus |&gt; \n  tidyr::unnest(c(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::left_join(tag_categories, by=\"tag\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(tag_category == \"discipline\", !is.na(tag)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::group_by(tag) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(dplyr::n() &gt; 1)\n\ndisciplines |&gt; \n  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(y=tag)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_bar() +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    y = \"Discipline\",\n    x = glue::glue(\"Number of Articles (n = {nrow(disciplines)}).\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Musicology and Visual Arts have probably been overlooked in the early history of CHS.

By the mid-sixties, mini-computers were becoming more popular, two of the most famous brands being Control Data Corporation (CDC) and Digital Equipment Corporation (who manufactured the PDP line of computers). The Illiac computers present a fascinating case of early use of computation in the Human Sciences. As well as a statistical machine, it was a machine for musical composition, and was used to create the Illiac Suite (Hiller and Baker 1964). You can listen to part of the suite on Spotify:"
