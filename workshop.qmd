title: "Workshop: Madness in Method"

Computation is more than a tool—it is a way of thinking. Or is it? Join us for a short-day workshop to meet digital researchers across the HASS disciplines, to critique the concepts of ‘digital’ and ‘method’, and to establish a set of principles for the adoption of digital methods. The workshop features provocative keynotes, an interactive data session, lightning talks, structured interaction and will culminate in the collective authorship of 10 Theses on Method.

**Where:** The Digital Lab, Arts West, University of Melbourne

**When:** Wednesday, September the 10th, 10AM-4PM
